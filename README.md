# The Minecraft RWBY Mod (final name tbd)

So I randomly decided to try and make a RWBY mod. Yeah. This is a thing. Go figure.

If you wanna contribute, feel free. I can always use the help ^-^

You can keep up with development on [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZWQDtqj).

(Yes, I know there was [this mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2512992) a while back as well; however, considering it hasn't been updated in about 2 years, I considered the source material fair game.)

RWBY and all related character, images, trademarks, etc. are property of Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC. I do not own any of the source material this mod is derived from; this is a fan-made mod intended to support the series. Please support the official release.
