# The Minecraft RWBY Mod (final name tbd)

So I randomly decided to try and make a RWBY mod. Yeah. This is a thing. Go figure.

If you wanna contribute, feel free. I can always use the help ^-^

You can keep up with development on [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZWQDtqj).

(Yes, I know there was [this mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2512992) a while back as well; however, considering it hasn't been updated in about 2 years, I considered the source material fair game.)

RWBY and all related character, images, trademarks, etc. are property of Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC. I do not own any of the source material this mod is derived from; this is a fan-made mod intended to support the series. Please support the official release.

## Images, etc.

Dust ore glows in the dark of a cave. Be careful when mining it; it might explode!

All in all there are eight types of dust, 4 primary (Wind, Fire, Water, and Earth) and 4 secondary (Lightning, Ice, Steam, and Gravity). Primary dust types can be found as ores, while secondary types must be crafted.

Dust can also be crystallized, resulting in a significantly less... *volatile* form.

The GUI of the Scroll item; this will eventually serve as the mod's guidebook, among other functions.
